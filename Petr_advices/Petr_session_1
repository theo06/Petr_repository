 a char is 1 byte long
[10:17:13] jose dim1: and an int is 4 byte long
[10:17:20] Peter Skovoroda: yes
[10:17:42] Peter Skovoroda: first of all, char, int, long, float, etc are types

You know, code written in C should be compiled. If you just give your processor instruction like "for", he'll think you're drunk.
So when you declare a variable, you telling the COMPILER "I need a space for this variable". And the size can be declared by type. char is 1 byte, int is 4 (not all the time. It can be 2,4,8), long is 8 et

What I'm trying to say, is that all types are actually telling how big the variable is and nothing more. And that's important. Because in other languages (let's say Python) declaring a string means you have a string. you can't work with it like with plane memory. In C you can. And you should understand it.

 jose dim1: a pointer is a variable which contains the adress of another variable.
[10:26:04] Peter Skovoroda: right. It's just another 8 bytes variable, containing the address. Nothing more. It's not a super-duper interesting C type. It's just variable type of long, with the address.
[10:26:18] Peter Skovoroda: it means, it also has an address. Like other variables

[10:27:17] Peter Skovoroda: When you do *ptr you telling the compiler, that you need a data from this ptr address.
[10:28:00] Peter Skovoroda: and **ptr means data from address from data from ptr address

but ptr only contains the address, not the size of the variable.
Like if you have int *ptr = something_something, can you do char var=*ptr?
[10:30:08] Peter Skovoroda: that's a question for you
[10:30:23] jose dim1: * ptr is an int
[10:30:42] jose dim1: so i think an int cannot be stored in a char.
[10:30:51] jose dim1: or maybe there is an implicit cast
[10:31:39] Peter Skovoroda: modern compilers will raise a warning, but you actualy can.
[10:32:03] Peter Skovoroda: you can even trick it doing implicit cast to int->void->char

and what will you see if you'll do char c=*i_ptr?
[10:32:52] Peter Skovoroda: what value will be stored in c?
[10:33:17] jose dim1: if i_ptr is a pointer to an int?
[10:33:25] Peter Skovoroda: yes
[10:34:05] jose dim1: what will be stored in c is the character which have an ascii value equals to *i_ptr
[10:35:50] Peter Skovoroda: I doesn't have to have an ascii value. You know, you can stor negative values in char, right?
[10:36:12] Peter Skovoroda: and here is an ascii table: http://www.asciitable.com/index/asciifull.gif
it's from 0 to 127

and *i_ptr may equal to 30000. Which ascii variable is it?
[10:37:28] Peter Skovoroda: so you don't know, right?

As you said int is 4 bytes, and char is only 1 byte.
The *i_ptr will contain the address of the first byte in memory. And when you do this:
int i = *i_ptr; The machine will read 4 bytes from the address i_ptr. But when you do this:
char c = *i_ptr; The machine will read only 1 byte, thinking that here's nothing more.
[10:40:52] Peter Skovoroda: I made you a small funny example, that may help you understand:
[10:41:04] Peter Skovoroda: Title: 0_basics.tar.gz Description: 0_basics.tar.gz https://login.skype.com/login/sso?go=webclient.xmm&docid=0-neu-d1-13aac98f7248492d87adf7dbb5056710

ell, hex value is 0-F (16 states), which is 4 bits.
then 1 byte (8 bits) can be represented by two hex like FF

[11:08:13] Peter Skovoroda: well. The thing is that negative values stores with first bit being 1, and positive with first bit being 0.

tha'ts why hex 7F is 127 and 80 is -128
[11:09:26] Peter Skovoroda: then it grows and FF means -1
[11:09:54] Peter Skovoroda: so it's 0,1....127,-128,-127,...,-1
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement

 dont understand why     printf("First 4 bytes %X\n", *piarr); /* Why it's 3020100, not 10203? */
[11:26:21] Peter Skovoroda: tha
[11:27:43] jose dim1: why 10203?
[11:28:45] Peter Skovoroda: sorry kernel crush
[11:28:56] Peter Skovoroda: give me a second
[11:28:59] jose dim1: ok
[11:30:40] Peter Skovoroda: ok, I'm here.
[11:30:43] Peter Skovoroda: so
[11:31:32] Peter Skovoroda: that's because of you processor representation
[11:31:34] Peter Skovoroda: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
[11:33:04] Peter Skovoroda: so in big-endian it will be 0123 and in little-endiad it's 3210
[11:33:29] Peter Skovoroda: every x86/x86_64 processor is little-endian
[11:37:35] jose dim1: how does  3020100 represent the first 4 bytes?


Peter Skovoroda: it actually 03020100. or 03 - first byte, 02 - second byte, 01 - third byte, 00 - 4th.
It just don't show you the first 0
[11:46:00] Peter Skovoroda: because in human readable way 03 is 3, 04 is 4 etc

0100 is 100\
[11:48:30] jose dim1: and why not  00010203 ?
[11:48:36] jose dim1: because of big little endian thing?
[11:48:44] Peter Skovoroda: because of the little endian
[11:49:24] Peter Skovoroda: in memory it's still 00 01 02 03, but processor starts reading from the lest significant byte (03)
[11:49:32] Peter Skovoroda: that's why it's reversed
[11:50:28] jose dim1: but for me 03 is the most heaviest byte. i dont understand why you say 03 is the the lest significant byte
[11:50:54] jose dim1: 03 in hex is 0000 0111 in bits
[11:51:05] Peter Skovoroda: nonono.
least significant means the last in memory
[11:51:33] Peter Skovoroda: you can do FF BB CC AA, it will still be reversed

---------------------session 2
Peter Skovoroda: the least significant is first - little endian
[10:20:50] Peter Skovoroda: Big-endian and little-endian are terms that describe the order in which a sequence of bytes are stored in computer memory. Big-endian is an order in which the "big end" (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first (at the lowest storage address). Little-endian is an order in which the "little end" (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first. For example, in a big-endian computer, the two bytes required for the hexadecimal number 4F52 would be stored as 4F52 in storage (if 4F is stored at storage address 1000, for example, 52 will be at address 1001). In a little-endian system, it would be stored as 524F (52 at address 1000, 4F at 1001).

look
[10:22:38] Peter Skovoroda: i is AABB;
AA - first byte, BB - last byte, right?
[10:22:47] jose dim1: ok
[10:22:48] Peter Skovoroda: AABB is value!
[10:23:21] Peter Skovoroda: then, if it is a value, how AABB will be stored in memory?
[10:23:43] Peter Skovoroda: first goes least significant (or the last byte) BB
[10:23:47] Peter Skovoroda: then AA
[10:24:00] Peter Skovoroda: so value AABB in memory will be stored as BBAA

 ok. and AABBCCDD will be stored as DDCCBBAA?
[10:24:57] Peter Skovoroda: yes
[10:25:25] Peter Skovoroda: and AADD00BB will be BB00DDAA
[10:25:28] Peter Skovoroda: reverse order
[10:25:46] Peter Skovoroda: that's what little endian means

so if int i = 0xAABBCC;
[10:28:31] jose dim1: char c = i;
[10:28:41] jose dim1: it is CC who will be stored in c?
[10:28:51] Peter Skovoroda: correct

 and the picture I made should explain, why not AA
[10:29:57] jose dim1: i think i got it
[10:30:22] Peter Skovoroda: think of it, as, I don't know, boxes
[10:30:45] Peter Skovoroda: you have 4 boxes, but you can only carry 2 at the same time
[10:30:50] Peter Skovoroda: so you take first two
[10:30:53] Peter Skovoroda: right?
[10:30:57] jose dim1: yes
[10:31:06] Peter Skovoroda: same thing with variables
[10:31:43] Peter Skovoroda: int is 4 bytes, but char can contain only 1 byte.
So it takes only the first byte from memory
[10:32:01] jose dim1: ok but the value AABB is two bytes right?
[10:32:15] Peter Skovoroda: yes
[10:32:35] jose dim1: so you can store less than 4 bytes into an int.
[10:32:43] Peter Skovoroda: no
[10:32:48] Peter Skovoroda: it's still four
[10:32:52] Peter Skovoroda: just 0000AABB
[10:32:57] jose dim1: aah ok
[10:33:01] Peter Skovoroda: in reverse order: BBAA0000

 for example with
[10:36:20] jose dim1:  struct ls {
	struct s s_obj;
	int i;
    };
[10:36:53] jose dim1: does it mean that the s_obj field of ls will be field with {NULL, NULL} ?
[10:37:22] jose dim1: because s_obj is a struct which contains a pointer to a function and an array?
[10:37:26] Peter Skovoroda: not NULL, NULL, but NULL, 0 0 0 0 0
[10:37:28] Peter Skovoroda: look
[10:37:41] Peter Skovoroda: think of a stucture, as a contiguous block in memory
[10:37:49] Peter Skovoroda: long block of bytes
[10:37:56] Peter Skovoroda: now fill every byte with 0
[10:38:04] Peter Skovoroda: like
[10:38:05] Peter Skovoroda: int


int is four bytes. Doing int = 0 you fill 4 bytes with zeros
[10:38:37] Peter Skovoroda: now struct is, let's say, 20 bytes long
[10:38:44] Peter Skovoroda: you fill them with zeros
[10:38:53] Peter Skovoroda: that's initialization
[10:39:25] jose dim1: and if we put 0 inside a pointer it is the same as putting NULL inside it I guess.
[10:39:25] Peter Skovoroda: *ptr = NULL means 0000000000000000 ( 8 bytes )
[10:39:34] Peter Skovoroda: yes
[10:39:44] Peter Skovoroda: NULL is a code word
[10:39:50] Peter Skovoroda: which means NULL pointer

: in other words
struct s s_obj = {0};
is just an easier way to do:
struct s s_obj = {.func=NULL, .c_arr = { 0,0,0,0,0 }};

 Peter Skovoroda: well, kinda
[10:51:29] Peter Skovoroda: you see
when you do *(&s_obj) the compiler will take sizeof(struct s) bytes from address &s_obj. right?
[10:52:47] jose dim1: *(&s_obj) does nothing i think?
[10:53:29] Peter Skovoroda: now.
when you cast &s_obj to (struct ls *) the compiler will think, that at the given address he can read sizeof(struct ls) bytes
[10:54:42] Peter Skovoroda: so it will read sizeof(struct s) bytes and additional (sizeof(struct ls) - sizeof(struct s)) bytes from the right


 (line 42) you have variable i (4 bytes). You see?
[11:02:09] jose dim1: yes
[11:02:09] Peter Skovoroda: to the right of it there is c_arr[8]
[11:02:14] jose dim1: yes i see
[11:02:40] Peter Skovoroda: so. If you try to read 8 bytes from i (4 bytes) what will you have?
[11:03:03] Peter Skovoroda: you will have 4 bytes of i and left 4 bytes of c_arr[8]
[11:03:10] jose dim1: yes

i am talking about ls_obj
[11:06:42] Peter Skovoroda: well, yes. Because size of struct ls is : sizeof(struct s) + sizeof(int)
[11:07:26] Peter Skovoroda: and you have sizeof(struct s) bytes declared. That's mean int will be garbage

Peter Skovoroda: b = i;
[11:15:25] Peter Skovoroda: here i isn't a value. It s a block of memory
[11:15:59] Peter Skovoroda: so, the block of memory i will be copied to the block of memory b
[11:16:26] Peter Skovoroda: when you store a VALUE, it will be stored in reverse order
[11:16:32] jose dim1: ok
[11:16:42] Peter Skovoroda: when you copy a block of memory it will be copied exactly
[11:17:48] Peter Skovoroda: when the value will be printed, it will be read in reverse order again
[11:18:02] Peter Skovoroda: in human readable way
[11:18:46] jose dim1: ok if I well understood when you do .c_arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } in the computer it is stored 0504030201
[11:18:46] Peter Skovoroda: so, when you store AABB, it will be store as BBAA,
when you'll try to print it, you'll still see AABB
[11:19:07] Peter Skovoroda: no
[11:19:11] Peter Skovoroda: that s the idea
[11:19:18] Peter Skovoroda: it's an array of CHARS
[11:19:22] Peter Skovoroda: char is 1 byte
[11:19:27] Peter Skovoroda: there is nothing to reverse
[11:19:36] Peter Skovoroda: so it's stored as 01 02 03 04 05
[11:19:37] Peter Skovoroda: but
[11:19:48] Peter Skovoroda: when you print 8 bytes as one variable
[11:19:59] Peter Skovoroda: it will be printed in reverse order.
[11:20:10] Peter Skovoroda: as 0504030201
[11:20:23] Peter Skovoroda: remember ex0?
[11:20:26] Peter Skovoroda: same thing
[11:20:51] Peter Skovoroda: if you store an array of chars, it will store them in line one by one
[11:21:10] Peter Skovoroda: if you store int, the least significant byte goes first
[11:21:48] Peter Skovoroda: when you store an array of int, you store them one by one. But each value itself will be reversed

char arr[2] = {0xaa, 0xbb} - 2 values. will be stored as AABB
int = 0xaabb - 1 value. will be stored as BBAA0000
int arr[2] = {0xaabb, 0xccdd} - 2 values. will be stored BBAA0000DDCC0000

eter Skovoroda: yeah
[11:28:14] Peter Skovoroda: machine doesn't do it to piss you off.
It just works with numbers this way. You work with numbers as AABB, the computer as BBAA.
[11:28:51] Peter Skovoroda: so when you store AABB, you store AABB, not BBAA, but the computer works with them in reverse order.
[11:29:54] Peter Skovoroda: so when you mess with the raw memory, you should do it in a way the machine can understand - in reverse order

: shall I forgot the *el = proto in Monster{int hit_points; Object proto}; It takes too much time to see what is going on.
[11:32:46] Peter Skovoroda: you didn't understand?
[11:33:42] Peter Skovoroda: the last example (ls_reverse_obj) should expain what will happen
[11:33:43] jose dim1: no, i didnt really understand the reverse monster
[11:36:41] Peter Skovoroda: I don't know, man. It's literally the same example.
Okay. Try to replase ls_reverse_obj with Monster{int hit_points; Object proto}; s_obj with Object and see what will happen.
[11:37:27] jose dim1: ok so when we do c_arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} it will store as 0102030405 because it is a char array
[11:37:59] jose dim1: but what happens to the .func pointer inside s_obj inside ls_reverse?
[11:38:30] Peter Skovoroda: it contains 0102030405
[11:38:46] Peter Skovoroda: which may be printed as 0504030201 (reverse order)
[11:38:50] jose dim1: ok understood
[11:39:08] jose dim1: no wait.
[11:39:27] jose dim1: why does the .func will contain 0102030405 and not the adress of the array?

… it does contains the address, stored in c_arr
[11:47:22] Peter Skovoroda: c_arr in memory is 0102030405
[11:47:53] Peter Skovoroda: when you read the whole c_arr at once (not as array of chars), you get it in reverse order
[11:47:59] Peter Skovoroda: as one long variable

 If you still don't get it, you should return to this example later
[11:50:38] jose dim1: when you say read, you mean print?
[11:51:00] Peter Skovoroda: yes
