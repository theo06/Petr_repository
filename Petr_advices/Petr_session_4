what does mu_tests variable contain?
[10:28:00] Peter Nechaev: it's not a variable.
ifeq ($(COMMAND),mu_tests) means if $(COMMAND) == "mu_tests"

 Ok, so I fucked up the perfect explanation..
Let's try to keep it short.
# In project like this (library with separate modules), or kernel, where you have dozens of drivers,
you want to be able to build only one of them.
There's two ways to accomplish this: 1 - go to modules directory and run 'make'; 2 - run 'make module';
I always work in root directory (that's where I store tags and cscope files), so I use the second way.
So, I need to create rules for every module in the list. But that would make Makefile too long and
hard to read. That's why I store rules inside modules directory (like src/hello/Makefile)
Here's basic Makefile syntax:
VARIABLE = VALUE
target : deps
	rule
So, I store the list of modules into MODULES variable and do the following:
MODULES = hello
$(MODULES): build <= If target is in MODULES list, do
	cd src/$@ && $(MAKE) <= go to src/target and run 'make' there
# But I also want to be able to build module with or without debug messages.
Again, there's two ways: 1 - run 'make module CFLAGS+=-DDEBUG'; 2 - run 'make module dev'.
The first way is too hard to print, plus I don't know, if the module use DEBUG flag or something else.
But you can't just do 'make module dev'. make will think, that you have two targets: module and dev.
That's why I use simple trick. I create a new variable, called COMMAND, where I store dev parameter.
	cd src/$@ && $(MAKE) $(COMMAND)
So, now if you do 'make module COMMAND=dev', this will happen:
cd src/module && make dev
But I'm too lazy to write COMMAND=something, that's why I modify bashrc

 $(MAKE) not always equals to 'make'
[11:17:27] Peter Nechaev: like $(CC) not always 'gcc'

 Basically the same thing with tests.
Only here I decided not to write 'make hello_tests', which is long, but write 'make hello test'
[11:20:32] Peter Nechaev: wchich will be interpreted as 'make hello COMMAND=mu_tests'
[11:21:12] Peter Nechaev: which here:
	@$(MAKE) $(patsubst %,%_tests,$@)
will simply run 'make hello_tests'
[11:22:50] jose dim1: what happens when it will run make hello_tests ?

Peter Nechaev: Makefile : line 40
[11:23:53] Peter Nechaev: $(TESTS): MODULE = $(patsubst %_tests,%,$@) <= if target is in TESTS list, do:
[11:31:43] Peter Nechaev: so?..
[11:32:23] jose dim1: it will do make hello COMMAND=test
[11:33:21] Peter Nechaev: I mean, did you finish reading?
[11:33:47] jose dim1: yeah but i dont understand everything
[11:33:56] Peter Nechaev: What exactly?
[11:34:22] jose dim1: the $(TESTS) rule
[11:35:21] jose dim1: for example if we do make hello test it will run make hello_tests and because hello_tets is in TESTS list, it will do
[11:35:33] jose dim1: MODULE= hello
[11:35:59] jose dim1: then make hello COMMAND= test will run another instance of make
[11:36:42] jose dim1: and because hello is in MODULES list it will run
[11:37:14] Peter Nechaev: it will run
cd src/hello && make test
[11:37:17] Peter Nechaev: so?
[11:38:46] jose dim1: no it will not run cd src/hello && make test it will run 	@$(MAKE) $(patsubst %,%_tests,$@)
[11:39:25] Peter Nechaev: no it won't
[11:39:38] Peter Nechaev: COMMAND==test, not mu_tests
[11:40:12] jose dim1: but in make_func() we have
[11:40:16] jose dim1:  if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
        case $2 in
            dev)
                args="$1 COMMAND=dev"
                ;;
            lib)
                args="$1 COMMAND=lib"
                ;;
            test)
                args="$1 COMMAND=mu_tests"
                ;;
            *)
                args=$@
                ;;
        esac
    else
        args=$@
    fi


Peter Nechaev: in terminal: make hello test =>
in bashrc: make hello COMMAND=mu_tests =>
in make 27: make hello_tests =>
in make 45: make hello COMMAND=test =>
in make 30: cd src/hello && make test
[11:44:03] jose dim1: ah ok bashrc is only used at the beginning
[11:44:18] Peter Nechaev: It only used in terminal
[11:44:33] Peter Nechaev: make runs by itself. It doesn't need bash
[11:45:10] jose dim1: ok so if write $(MAKE) inside a Makefile, it will run another instance of the Makefile without lookking into the bashrc
[11:45:38] Peter Nechaev: another instance of make, not makefile
[11:45:49] Peter Nechaev: in the working directory

jose dim1: to go back to what you said, it will do cd src/hello && make test
[11:47:32] jose dim1: it will cd into src/hello and create build/libhello.a library
[11:48:17] jose dim1: but after doing this, make returns to the root directory?
[11:49:03] Peter Nechaev: the instanse you run in line 45 exits and your makefile continues
[11:49:34] Peter Nechaev: and the parent instanse always was in root directory
[11:50:09] jose dim1: when you exits the instance run in line 45, you also cd ../.. to go back to the parent instance directory?
[11:50:31] Peter Nechaev: The parent instanse always in root
[11:50:34] jose dim1: i mean it cd ../.. automatically?
[11:50:37] Peter Nechaev: no need to go back
[11:50:56] Peter Nechaev: another instanse just exited, no need for it to go back either
[11:51:15] Peter Nechaev: It's like running bash script inside the bash script
[11:51:27] Peter Nechaev: or having a dream inside a dream
[11:51:56] Peter Nechaev: if you die in the second dream, you don't have to go back to life in first dream
[11:52:20] Peter Nechaev: it's simply another process
[11:52:28] Peter Nechaev: it doesn't affect main instance
[11:52:37] jose dim1: ok
[11:53:53] jose dim1: so next instruction will be make test/hello_tests CFLAGS+=-Isrc/hello LDLIBS+=build/libhello.a
[11:54:23] jose dim1: but what will it do? because there is no test/hello_tests target.
[11:54:36] jose dim1: is it an implicit rule?


 Peter Nechaev: http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex2.html
[11:55:27] Peter Nechaev: make will look for a file module.c
[11:55:40] Peter Nechaev: in the directory tests/
[11:56:20] jose dim1: you mean a file called hello_tests.c in the directory tests/ ?
[11:56:27] Peter Nechaev: yes
[11:56:31] jose dim1: and do like ex2 of zed
[11:57:52] jose dim1: If i well understood, your skeleton's makefile doesn t work without the latest make_func() you gave me?
[11:58:20] Peter Nechaev: well, no
[11:58:34] Peter Nechaev: makefile works perfectly
[11:58:46] Peter Nechaev: you just have to use COMMAND=... syntax
[11:59:17] jose dim1: ok, so each time i run your skeleton makefile it is better to include your make_func() inside my bashrc.
[11:59:39] Peter Nechaev: em.. no
[11:59:49] Peter Nechaev: it's just an example
[11:59:57] Peter Nechaev: you implement only the parts you like
[12:00:31] Peter Nechaev: I like it this way, you may want something else
[12:01:47] jose dim1: i have an idea. maybe i can keep only this part of your make_func(), to be able to use your makefile
[12:01:48] jose dim1: if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
        case $2 in
            dev)
                args="$1 COMMAND=dev"
                ;;
            lib)
                args="$1 COMMAND=lib"
                ;;
            test)
                args="$1 COMMAND=mu_tests"
                ;;
            *)
                args=$@
                ;;
        esac
    else
        args=$@
    fi
[12:02:21] jose dim1: and don t keep this part, to add my own grc colours into conf.gcc (because grc make use conf.gcc)
[12:02:24] jose dim1: cerr=$(echo -e "\033[1;31m")
    cwarn=$(echo -e "\033[1;35m")
    cdbg=$(echo -e "\033[1;33m")
    cbold=$(echo -e "\033[1;39m")
    cend=$(echo -e "\033[0m")

    grc make $args | sed -E -e "s%(error)\ (\(.*?\):)%$cerr\1 $cbold\2$cend%g" \
        -e "s%(warning)\ (\(.*?\):)%$cwarn\1 $cbold\2$cend%g" \
        -e "s%(info)\ (\(.*?\):)%$cbold\1 \2$cend%g" \
        -e "s%(debug)\ (\(.*?\):)%$cdbg\1 $cbold\2$cend%g" \
        -e "s%FAILED%$cerr&$cend%g"
[12:02:46] Peter Nechaev: of course

: ok and when doing make clean
[12:07:34] jose dim1: it will run another instance of make: make hello COMMAND=clean
[12:08:04] jose dim1: and because hello is inside $(MODULES) it will run $(MODULES)
[12:08:19] jose dim1: cd src/hello && make clean
[12:08:58] jose dim1: and if we do make clean and MODULES = hello list
[12:09:39] Peter Nechaev: it will do make clean for every moduel
[12:09:42] Peter Nechaev: in list

 $(MAKE) $(MODULES) COMMAND=clean is the same as make hello COMMAND=clean && make list COMMAND=clean ?
[14:47:49] Peter Nechaev: almost.
[14:48:10] Peter Nechaev: like make module1 module2 - will build both
[14:48:58] Peter Nechaev: COMMAND here is a variable (like CFLAGS). So, yes, it will do what you said but inside one make command
[14:49:08] Peter Nechaev: not inside one bash instruction
